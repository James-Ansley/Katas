# Parrot Refactoring Kata (Python)

Kata from: <https://github.com/emilybache/Parrot-Refactoring-Kata>

## Comments

I got on to this kata from Bache's video on refactoring in Python using this as
an example (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO_5DQ3vDtc>). After working on a
few small Java projects that were in need of refactoring, I must say I am a
little tired of the lack of refactoring support in Python. Although, I can
understand it â€” I've worked on Python static analysis projects in the past, and
there are always weird edge cases that mean you can never quite draw strong
conclusions about what is going on in code statically without making some
assumptions about the features of Python that are used. Guess that's the price
we pay for loosey-goosey dynamic types and easy reflection.
