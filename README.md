# Katas

My attempts at various code katas.

## A Note on Kata Setups

In general, I am keeping project setups minimal for each kata.
For example, Python implementations typically use a minimal package structure:

```
<Kata Name>/python
├── <kata_name>.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── [requirements.txt]
└── tests.py
```

This isn't to say I would set up these projects like this out in the wild.
