# Tennis Refactoring Kata (Python)

## Comments

For these exercises, I first created my own solution (`tennis_0`). I then
refactored the six other exercises. I found these refactoring exercises fun.
Weirdly, I found I liked my solution for `tennis_5` better than my own â€” in a
way it is a direct translation of the game rules; given the simplicity of the
code in this exercise it feels fitting.
