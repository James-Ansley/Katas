## Comments

`calculate_stats` is my attempt at this problem from scratch. I have been
somewhat bold in making my solution work for _Iterables_ rather than
_Sequences_. My solution was most similar to `calculate_stats_3`
with `StatSummary` and `StatsReport` objects grouping together item statistics.

### Pain Points

Maybe not necessarily a pain-point, but this exercise reminded me of the types
of exercises I give to first-year computer science students. I always find these
types of problems hard to write tests for when students are involved because
they so oft' tend to write the weirdest code that hits edge cases beyond mere
mortals' comprehension.
